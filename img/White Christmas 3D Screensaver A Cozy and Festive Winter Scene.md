Besides being visually appealing, 3D screensavers also have some other benefits that you might not be aware of. Here are some of them:
 
- 3D screensavers can help you relax and reduce stress. Watching the soothing movements of fish, water, stars or other 3D objects can have a calming effect on your mind and body. You can also choose a screensaver that matches your mood or interests, such as nature, space, fantasy or sports.
- 3D screensavers can protect your privacy and security. If you leave your computer unattended for a while, a screensaver can prevent others from seeing your personal or work-related information on the screen. Some screensavers also require a password to resume the session, adding an extra layer of protection.
- 3D screensavers can contribute to scientific research. Some screensavers are part of volunteer computing projects that use your idle computer resources to perform complex calculations for various fields of science, such as astronomy, biology, medicine or mathematics. You can join these projects and help advance human knowledge while enjoying a stunning 3D display.
- 3D screensavers can showcase your creativity and personality. You can create your own 3D screensavers using software tools that allow you to transform your photos and videos into dynamic and interactive 3D scenes. You can also add special effects, music and animations to make them more lively and unique. You can then share your creations with your friends and family or upload them to online platforms.

As you can see, 3D screensavers are more than just eye candy. They can enhance your computer experience in many ways and offer you a lot of fun and enjoyment. So why not give them a try and see for yourself?
